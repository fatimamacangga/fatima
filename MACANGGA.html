            <h1> friends</h1>

            <p>Being friends is about sharing our lives with others.
            There are some aspects of our lives that require that we spend a lot of time together. 
            Other times sharing only a few words are more than adequate. 
            It is not always the long conversation that conveys the deepest feelings.
            Sometimes, longer modes of expression may seem redundant and lacking in profundity. 
            Putting just the right combination of words on paper in a succinct style may just
            hit the spot.</p>
